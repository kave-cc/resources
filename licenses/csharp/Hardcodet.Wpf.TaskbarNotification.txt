<h4>The Code Project Open License (CPOL) 1.02</h4>

<p>The Code Project Open License (CPOL) is intended to provide developers who choose to share their code with a license that protects them and provides users of their code with a clear statement regarding how the code can be used.
</p>
<p>
The CPOL is our gift to the community. We encourage everyone to use this license if they wish regardless of whether the code is posted on CodeProject.com.
